OPERATOR FILE — Anubhav Rajput Portfolio

> A Call of Duty: Mission Brief themed personal portfolio website built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks. No dependencies. Just one file.

 📸 Theme & Concept

The entire portfolio is designed around a **Call of Duty tactical mission briefing** aesthetic. Every section is reimagined as a military operation — skills become your "arsenal", projects become "mission logs", education becomes "training & clearance", and the contact section is the "extraction point."

The goal was to make a portfolio that **stands out** from the typical clean/minimal developer portfolios — this one has personality, atmosphere, and a memorable identity.
